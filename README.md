# NourishNet
NourishNet is a console-based app tackling food insecurity and waste by connecting donors, NGOs, and volunteers. It streamlines food donation, resource access, logistics, and oversight, ensuring surplus food reaches those in need. Our goal: reduce waste, fight hunger, and foster collaboration.
